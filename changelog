v0.02

  * Single chanel for one neuron. All input signals are marked by source
  neurons and pushed to the input chanel of linked neuron. So we don't need
  more then one thread for every neuron. So we don't need mutexes.
  * NeurNet Stops if stabilized in binary state (some neuron(s) blinks between two
  values).
  * Reducing cascade rising of signal numbers with many back links.
  Situation like this
  
             -> N0 <-
            |  / \   |
            \_N1  N2_/
  
  leads to unlimited rising of signal numbers. Now this problem is solved
  with pair of blocking and unblocking selects of input. Calc() is started
  after receiving all of signals in the chanel.

v0.01

  * First version of multithreaded absolutely asyncronous NeurNet with
  arbitrary structure.
  * No multithread problems with(out) mutexes. (go build --race / go run
  --race).
  * Random constructor of NeurNet.
